Companion Data for the book _The Data Preparation Journey: Finding Your Way With R_

* published by Chapman & Hall/CRC Press on 2024-05-07.

* the web version of book is available [here](https://bookdown.org/martin_monkman/DataPreparationJourney_draft/)


## Installation

To download and install the {dpjr} package, you will need the {remotes} package:

```
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("monkmanmh/dpjr")
```
Once you have {dpjr} installed, load it using the `library()` function:

```
library(dpjr)
```

## Usage

There are two groups of datasets in the package: pre-rendered? tables, and raw files.

### Raw data files

The convenience function `dpjr_data()` generates the path to the raw data file, independent of the specific location on the user's computer.

For example, to read the CSV file "mpg.csv":

```
df_mtcars <- read.csv(dpjr::dpjr_data("mpg.csv"))
```

An alternative to this approach is to access files using the `system.file()` function.

Example:


```
system.file("extdata", package = "dpjr")

system.file("extdata", "mpg.csv", package = "dpjr")

read.csv(system.file("extdata", "mpg.csv", package = "dpjr"))
```

## Data files

A list of the the raw data files [can be found in the vignette "Data list"](articles/data_list.html). 


### National Travel Survey data

Note that the National Travel Survey (NTS) data referenced in Chapter 7 of the book is _not_ included in the {dpjr} package. The microdata file for the 2020 reference year can be found here:

* Additional information about the NTS can be found here: https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&Id=1535550&
