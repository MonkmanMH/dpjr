## Raw data

This page is a listing of the raw data files in the {dpjr} package. The files can be accessed using the appropriate "read" function, with the package function `dpjr_data()` providing the path. For example, 

```
df_mpg <- read.csv(dpjr_data("mpg.csv"))
```

The full list of files is as follows:

```{r data_list}
dpjr::dpjr_data()
```


## Licenses

All of the data in this package is covered under an open license. For information about the specific license for each data set in this package, please refer to [the vignette "Data licenses"](data_licenses.html). 



## Files

### authors_fwf.txt; authors2_fwf.txt

```


#### penguins_fwf.txt

A fixed-width version of the [{palmerpenguins} dataset](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/)

There are 8 different variables, described in the table below:

Variable           Width   Start position   End position
--------           -----   --------------   ------------
species            9       1                9
island             9       10               18
bill_length_mm     4       19               22
bill_depth_mm      4       23               26
flipper_length_mm  3       27               29
body_mass_g        4       30               33
sex                6       34               39
year               4       40               43




The fixed-width file has been created to minimize white space. The first four and last two rows of the data look like this:


```{r penguin_readLines_head}
readLines(dpjr::dpjr_data("penguins_fwf.txt"), n = 4)
```

```{r penguin_readLines_tail}
tail(readLines(dpjr::dpjr_data("penguins_fwf.txt")), 2)
```

Note that the first row is _not_ the variable names. This is common in fixed-width files.

```
# code to create fwf file
gdata::write.fwf(penguins_df, file = "penguins_fwf.txt",
                 width = c(
                   9,   # species
                   9,   # island
                   4,   # bill_length_mm
                   4,   # bill_depth_mm
                   3,   # flipper_length_mm
                   4,   # body_mass_g
                   6,   # sex
                   4    # year
                 ),
                 sep = "",
                 colname = FALSE)

```

#### penguins_fwf_code.txt

A fixed-width version of the [{palmerpenguins} dataset](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/), where the character strings associated with the values have been replaced by numeric values.

There are 8 different variables, described in the table below:

Variable           Width   Start position   End position
--------           -----   --------------   ------------
species            1       1                1
island             1       2                2
bill_length_mm     4       3                6
bill_depth_mm      4       7                10
flipper_length_mm  3       11               13
body_mass_g        4       14               17
sex                1       18               18
year               4       19               22


Variable   Value  Character 
--------   -----  ---------
species    1      Adelie
           2      Gentoo
           3      Chinstrap
island     1      Torgersen
           2      Biscoe
           3      Dream
sex        1      female
           2      male
           


The fixed-width file is now less than half the width of the fixed-width file that has the character values. The first four and last two rows of the data look like this:


```{r penguin_code_readLines_head}
readLines(dpjr::dpjr_data("penguins_fwf_code.txt"), n = 4)
```

```{r penguin_code_readLines_tail}
tail(readLines(dpjr::dpjr_data("penguins_fwf_code.txt")), 2)
```

Note that the first row is _not_ the variable names. This is common in fixed-width files.

#### penguins_spss_output.xlsx

An Excel version of the [{palmerpenguins} dataset](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).

This file simulates the circumstance where the data were originally collected and stored in an SPSS file, and the data collectors have made the data available as an Excel file.


The file contains two sheets,

* **penguins_values**, containing the individual records, with the variables coded numerically. Note that for all variables, "NA" is used to represent missing values.

* **penguins_codebook** contains the output SPSS creates when the "DISPLAY DICTIONARY" syntax (or the "File > Display Data File Information > Working File" GUI menu sequence) in SPSS is used to produce the "dictionary" (or codebook). There is information about each of the variables, including whether that variable is nominal or scale..



Variable   Value  Character 
--------   -----  ---------
species    1      Adelie
           2      Chinstrap
           3      Gentoo
island     1      Biscoe
           2      Dream
           3      Torgersen
sex        1      female
           2      male
